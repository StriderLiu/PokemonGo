# Algorithms and Accuracy

Logistic Regression, Neural Network and Decision Tree

  (1) With 3 rarity (common, rare and very rare), accuracy is 89.27% (We are using this option for final delivery.)
     
  (2) With 15 types, accuracy is around 40%
     
  (3) With 151 poke monsters, the highest accuracy we got is 22%

# Brief Instruction

To get started, you need Play activator UI and run it and least once. 

Pre-cleaned dataset and pre-loaded models are saved under resources folder.

Folder visualization contains images we screenshot from Zeppelin and Tableau.

Folder exploratory keeps are the works we did before this final delivery, including iPython file from anaconda and application from older version named PikaPika. We have not included Zeppelin notebooks yet
