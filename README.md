# Platform

1.Experiment on Zeppelin

2.Transplant to IDE

# Next Step

1.Data Cleansing
     
  (1) Drop these columns: pokemonId, appearedLocalTime, X_id, cellId_90m, cellId_180m, cellId_370m, cellId_730m, cellId_1460m, cellId_2920m, cellId_5850m, appearedDayOfWeek, appearedMonth, appearedYear, weatherIcon
     
  (2) Replace all "TURE" and "FALSE" with "1" and "0"
     
  (3) Represent appearedTimeOfDay, city, continent and weather as their corresponding number (start from 1)
     
  (4) Merge data from PokemonGO, add rarity and type data
     
  (5) Abstract US data
     
  (6) Normalization
     
2.Logistic Regression, Neural Network and Decision Tree

  (1) With 151 poke monster, the highest accuracy we got is 22%
     
  (2) With 3 rarities(common, rare and very rare), accuracy is 89.27%
     
  (3) With 15 types, accuracy is around 40%
